## 4 August 2024

1. DISCUSS: FreeCAD Developer’s forum alternatives and replacement as “official” source of discussion. (oursland)  
   1. Non-contributors causing conflicts, lack of effective moderation, and loss of new contributors.  
   2. Possibilities: GitHub Discussions, new PhpBB instance, Discourse, closed forum section, others?  
      1. Separation of users forum and developers forum?  
      2. GitHub Discussions does not have the moderation capabilities needed  
      3. GitHub Discussions would tie FreeCAD further with GitHub  
      4. Discourse may be a suitable option  
      5. Paid moderators may be a solution  
      6. Clean start lets us set up new rules and make it clear this is NOT the original forum  
      7. Possible FPA grant: someone to convert forums discussions into Issues  
      8. Code of conduct is in source tree: needs “teeth”  
      9. Create issue to modify the code  
2. FYI: Upcoming FPA-designed grants (chennes)  
   1. Addon Ecosystem Coordinator  
   2. OpenCASCADE Developer Liaison  
   3. Forums Moderators  
   4. Beginner project curator  
   5. Translatable Text Reviewer  
   6. (As always, feel free to make up your own at [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FPA-grant-proposals/issues](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FPA-grant-proposals/issues))  
3. DISCUSS: 1.0 status update and blocker discussion (chennes)  
4. DISCUSS: Community Ombudsperson (yorik)  
   1. “Organizational ombuds work with individuals and groups in an organization to (1) provide a safe space to talk about an issue or concern, (2) explore options to help resolve conflicts, and (3) bring systemic concerns to the attention of the organization for resolution.”  
   2. How is this person selected?  
   3. Combine this agenda item with Item 1 (code of conduct questions, etc.)  
   4. [https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/)  
      1. "Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by emailing khmer-project@idyll.org..."  
5. FYI: Unified website (homepage \+ blog) initiative (marcuspollio)  
   1. now has a [temporary repository](https://github.com/marcuspollio/FreeCAD-website/) and [site on GH Pages](https://marcuspollio.github.io/FreeCAD-website/)  
   2. feedback most welcome (directly here, on repository or [original issue](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Homepage/issues/165))  
   3. content contributions soon organised  
   4. New or old,Lack of up-to-date content: What can be done to provide more up-to-date content (screenshots, animations, etc.)?(reqrefusion)  
   5. Question 1: how to best coordinate effort to target the 1.0 release ?  
   6. Question 2: how about refreshing some of the current website content first ?  
   7. Alternative in-between solution (sisyphus) [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Homepage/pull/178](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Homepage/pull/178)  
      1. It is possible to make the [blog](https://cizgivedizi.com/FreeCAD-Homepage/blog-test.php) and [wiki](https://cizgivedizi.com/FreeCAD-Homepage/wiki-test.php) appear to be included in the site.  
      2. Faster results can be obtained.  
      3. There are also fewer dependencies. The jQuery dependency has been removed.  
6. DISCUSS: Linter warnings  
   1. See PR 15715: [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/15715](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/15715)  
   2. Disables several warnings discussed in last dev meeting  
   3. Leaves readability-identifier-length  
   4. Consider dropping all formatting-related warnings, in favor of continuing migration to clang-format in pre-commit?  
7. DISCUSS: Code quality (worser) (apologies, won’t be attending)  
   1. New code is less than optimal, burying the project in technical debt (stuff to fix later).   
   2. Unfortunately the bulk of FreeCAD code is very old, sets bad example  
   3. Current reviews (when they happen) focus on trivialities, ignore serious deficiencies  
      1. All PRs can be reviewed by anyone: code issues and discussions about specific code belong on GitHub  
      2. We need more reviewers\!  
      3. Maintainers Guide specifically focuses on community building  
   4. There are no guidelines for coders, or for reviewers  
      1. [https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/](https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/)  
      2. [https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/maintainersguide/](https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/maintainersguide/)  
      3. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)  
   5. I have created a 9pp document titled “re C++” highlighting 20 top issues seen in recent code here: [re C++](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=88567\&start=70). I would like to think this may be a small educational step. It is easy to read, formatted, includes examples and explanations, and is based on recent FreeCAD code.  
      1. Any advice should be a PR to the Handbook  
   6. Meta: discussion item from a non-FreeCAD developer who doesn’t even attend?  
8. DISCUSS: Meta: rolling agenda isn’t (chennes)  
   1. Switch to a “manual roll” of items that need to be discussed again next month  
   2. Going forward we will not roll  
9. DISCUSS change meeting day? (Obelisk)  
   1. How can we select a new date?  
   2. Move to twice per month? Choose a different date for the second?  
   3. TODO: Yorik will post about added Saturday meeting  
10. DISCUSS: Dropping support of Qt5 in the next release cycle \- when? (kadet)  
    1. Officially we tie to Ubuntu LTS, which is currently on Qt 5.12  
    2. Can we drop support in anticipation of the LTS migration in February 2025?
