DISCUSS:  Squash/Merge policy for git history  
    The Developers handbook [maintainers guide](https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/maintainersguide) briefly mentions merge/squash.  Let’s discuss this and get consensus on how much history to maintain.  
    Three options  
        Merge commit. Pros: preserves history:  Cons  adds extra committ  
        Rebase/Merge   pros:  cleaner  cons: loses signatures.  
               squash/merge   pros:  Only a single commit.  cons: Loses history

    Generally desire to have a meaningful history.  

Git bisect requires all commits to build/run  
Current rules ‘require’ developers to have clean history    
    May require a heuristic rather than a single rule  
        If the change is single / atomic  a squash/merge is preferred  
        If the developer went to the effort to structure a complicated change in multiple commits, we should preserve the history.
