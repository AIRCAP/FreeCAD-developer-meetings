11. (oursland) DISCUSS: Qt6 Migration Timeline  
    
    1. Prerequisites for Release  
       1. pivy  
    2. Timeline for Weekly Build  
    3. CI  
       1. Draft PR: [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14218](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14218)  
    4. (Ajinka) Support for Qt5 is already removed from some distributions  
    5. (chennes) We should target full Qt6 support for 1.0 release (Qt5 EOL is under a year away)  
    6. (chennes) Help needed for Windows LibPack generation with Qt6/Python 3.11 (or 3.12, now). See progress at [https://github.com/chennes/FreeCAD-LibPack/tree/addScript](https://github.com/chennes/FreeCAD-LibPack/tree/addScript)  

12. (oursland) DISCUSS: Python2 support?  
    
    1. Is this necessary?  No.  Oldest python support is \~py3.8  
    2. Can we remove from source tree? YES  

13. (openBrain) Does Ondsel have plans for the feature freeze period ?  
    
    1. Fixing bugs they introduced ?  
    2. Help fix other bugs ?  
    3. Ensure introduced features/changes are properly documented ?  
    4. Other ?  
    5. Brad: Ondsel will sponsor a “bug hunt”, but otherwise proceed as normal contributors  

14. (NomAnor) Global code formatting with clang-format during freeze?
    
    During it in single PRs generates big diffs in github, making it difficult to review
    
    This could allow everyone to do a clang-format (maybe even pre-commit hook) for their PRs without generating a huge diff of irrelevant changed.

(chennes) TODO \- talk to Werner about Part and PartDesign; Sketcher has a lot of files with // clang-format off

15. (chennes) Reminder: Feature freeze starts tomorrow  
16. (chennes) Registration opening soon for North American Meetup  
    1. 15-18 August, 2024, Springfield, IL  
    2. [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=85180](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=85180)  
17. For 1.1: Users are very interested in better rendering, particularly shadows (according to Ondsel’s research)  
    1. (Dave Carter) Appearance should be greatly improved by recent developments in materials.  
    2. Ondsel ships with OpenTheme, and gets good feedback on it  
18. Another feature for 1.1: Improved GD\&T  
19. (sliptonic) Is it possible to replace Coin3D? What other projects use it now?
