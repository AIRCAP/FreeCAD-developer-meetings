# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Saturday, 21 September 2024**

1. **Volunteer to take minutes**
2. **1.0 release status**
3. **(sliptonic) Need for a common assets location**

    There is a category of improvements to FreeCAD that should be deliverable via addons. These include but aren't limited to:
    - CAM post-processors and Tools
    - Better materials
    - TechDraw templates
    
    In the future, we could anticipate other kinds of assets like:
    - CAM vises, tool holders, clamps to make setup easier.
    - Stock configs for raytracing 
    - Robot definitions and CNC machines for simulation

    Currently, addons can only install into the `MOD` directory or the user macro directory. FreeCAD should have a dedicated assets location where addons can install resources that other workbenches and addons can use. For example:
    - TechDraw should look in `assets/Techdraw` for templates
    - CAM should look in `assets/CAM`, etc.
