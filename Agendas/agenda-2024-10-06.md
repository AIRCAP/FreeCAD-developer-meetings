# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 6 October 2024**

1. **Volunteer to take minutes**
   
3. **1.0 release status**
   
5. **Computional Fluid Dynamics** (sliptonic)
  
   Reports that getting Openfoam and CFD workbench working on FreeCAD (Mac) is too difficult.  We have requests from educators wanting to do this.  What can be done to make this easier?
   
7. **FYI: BIM development Project management** (marcuspollio, cannot attend due to time zone, sorry)
   
   A new [`BIM development` GitHub Project board](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/31) has been set up, similar to the `Mechanical Advisory Group`. Its aim to act as an development/roadmap interface and facilitate cooperation among the community, contributors, teams members (`CAD Advisory Group`, `Design Working Group`) for the advancement of FreeCAD in this field (built environment). People interested in joining can [contact us](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/16566) to be added as collaborator (you must be part of the FreeCAD org first).
