# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 6 October 2024**

1. **Volunteer to take minutes**

2. **1.0 release status**

3. **Computional Fluid Dynamics** (sliptonic)

   Reports that getting Openfoam and CFD workbench working on FreeCAD (Mac) is too difficult.  We have requests from educators wanting to do this.  What can be done to make this easier?

4. **FYI: BIM development Project management** (marcuspollio, cannot attend due to time zone, sorry)

   A new [`BIM development` GitHub Project board](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/31) has been set up, similar to the `Mechanical Advisory Group`. Its aim to act as an development/roadmap interface and facilitate cooperation among the community, contributors, teams members (`CAD Advisory Group`, `Design Working Group`) for the advancement of FreeCAD in this field (built environment). People interested in joining can [contact us](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/16566) to be added as collaborator (you must be part of the FreeCAD org first).

5. **DISCUSS: Repository housekeeping** (marcuspollio, idem)

   Currently, the `FreeCAD` Organisation has 51 `Public` repositories on GitHub. Some of them have not been updated since many years and could be `Archived`. Keeping around so many public repositories is a bit puzzling, can misguide or be subject to *necrobumping*. Doing a *little housekeeping* is also an opportunity to look back and consider which efforts were *successful* and which were less so. Here is a proposal for:

   <details><summary>Repositories to archive</summary>

   - [Old Homepage](https://github.com/FreeCAD/old_homepage) (last update August 2015)

   - [FreeCAD GitHub.io](https://github.com/FreeCAD/freecad.github.io) (last update March 2019)

   - [FreeCAD Blog](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-blog) (last update March 2019)

   - [FreeCAD Enhancement Proposals](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Enhancement-Proposals) (last update January 2021)

   - [Arch Design](https://github.com/FreeCAD/ArchDesign) (last update June 2021)

   - [FreeCAD 0.20](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-0-20) (last update October 2022)

   - [FreeCAD Getting Started](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Getting-Started) (last update March 2023)

   - [FreeCAD-1](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-1) (last update April 2023)

   - [FCAD Chennes](https://github.com/FreeCAD/fcad-chennes) (last update April 2023)
   </details>

   <details><summary>Eventually too</summary>

   - [FreeCAD Ports Cache (Travis CI on macOS)](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-ports-cache) (last update April 2019)

   - [API (docs from "make WebDoc")](https://github.com/FreeCAD/API) (last update June 2020)

   - [FreeCAD Icons](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-icons) (last update June 2020)

   - [FreeCAD Doc](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Doc) (last update February 2021)

   - [Source Doc](https://github.com/FreeCAD/SourceDoc) (last update August 2022)

   - [FreeCAD Documentation Docusaurus](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-documentation-docusaurus) (last update October 2023)
   </details>

   <details><summary>Suggestions</summary>

   - Rename [org.freecad.FreeCAD](https://github.com/FreeCAD/org.freecad.FreeCAD) with FlatHub/Flatpak in the name

   - Archive or update [Zstr (Zlib wrapper)](https://github.com/FreeCAD/zstr) (last update August 2022) as Upstream has a few more commits.
   </details>

   The number of public repositories would be reduced to 36.

6. **DISCUSS: Measure issues (hyarion)**

   There's been a bug Whac-A-Mole in Measure lately. How do we ensure Messure is stable enough for 1.0?

7. **DISCUSS: Translation workflow (hyarion)**

   Many crowdin suggestions (in various languages) have never been marked as accepted, so these changes never gets included. Can we improve the process? Do we need maintainers for translations?

8. **DISCUSS: Exception handling on macOS (hyarion)**

   FreeCAD crashes on macOS when event handlers fail to catch all exceptions. [Here's the issue](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/16905). What’s the best approach to address this?

9. **FYI: CAD Advisory Group topics** (pierreporte)

   - Presentation of a [“top 10” for the issues labelled P1](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/28/views/6) (announced on 2024-09-14).
   - Status of the file structure discussion: [see report](https://gist.github.com/pierreporte/6dd9b23d8296844516834d7afff05ce0).
  
10. **DISCUSS: SpaceMouse integration (chennes, cannot attend)**

   - 3Dconnexion wrote an integration for the Windows version that uses their driver, moves all settings there, and works like other CAD packages with spacemouse support
   - That is a compile-time option, which when enabled removes support for older spacemouse hardware
   - 3Dconnexion has no plans to make this a runtime option (see https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/17000)
   - We could release 1.0 as two versions, once with old option enabled (but this is work)
   - Going forward, if we want to support both at the same time, with a UI switch, we will have to implement that ourselves
